# Channel-coding-and-data-compression
We developed an algorithm using Huffman coding, Code for compressing a text file without data loss compression.
Encoding:  Using Huffman coding algorithm.  Take the input text file. For each new symbol add it to dictionary with key as the character and value as the number of repetions of that character. Once the dictionary is complete add generate the huffman tree corresponding to that frequency distribution.After the tree is assign the binary equivalent to each symbol of the file and store in a dictionary. Encode the file according to the dictionary.Output analysis:  •	The input is a text file, “alice.txt”, with size 149KB.   •	The total number of distinct characters encountered were 73. •	The size of the compressed file is 87.7KB.  Results obtained by the above data are:   •	Compression ratio: 55.45% •	 Saving percent:  44.54% •	The entropy of our code is calculated at the end of the execution, which is 4.5
